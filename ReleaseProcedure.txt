The maven release plugin turned out to be too hard to handle.
So we do it manually.

# Ensure we have all upstream updates (like patches from Renovate)
git pull

# Ensure all has been committed


# Ensure it all works
mvn clean verify -PpackageForRelease
mvn clean

# Publishing a SNAPSHOT version
mvn clean deploy -PpackageForRelease -PdeployToSonatype
